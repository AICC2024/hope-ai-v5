  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>HOPE.AI is an AI-powered education and compliance platform designed to help hospice care providers ask any question they have about HOPE (Hospice Outcomes & Patient Evaluation). Whether it’s about assessments, timelines, measures, or documentation, HOPE.AI delivers answers that are 100% based on official guidance from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) — ensuring every response is accurate, source-referenced, and up to date.</p>
